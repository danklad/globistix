             <p className="text-secondary dark:text-white"> Globistix connects global markets with India’s most celebrated origins — where trust, quality, and consistency come first. </p>
            </p>
             <p className="text-secondary dark:text-white"> From the misty hills of Coorg to the fertile fields of Guntur, we bring forward products that are not just traded worldwide, but respected for their provenance and performance. </p>

             <p className="text-secondary dark:text-white"> Coorg Coffee is known for its balanced and refined character. Our carefully sourced beans offer a smooth, medium-to-full body with mild acidity and a clean finish. The cup opens with gentle floral aromas, followed by layered notes of cocoa, chocolate, hazelnut, almond, warm spices, and caramel, finishing with subtle hints of ripe berries like cherry and strawberry. It’s a profile that appeals equally to specialty roasters and commercial buyers looking for consistency and depth. </p>
             <p className="text-secondary dark:text-white"> On the spice front, Guntur Chillies, especially the iconic Guntur Sannam S4, represent India’s dominance in global chilli exports. Renowned for their intense pungency and deep red colour, these chillies deliver a sharp heat in the range of 35,000–40,000 SHU, supported by a naturally high capsaicin content. Their flavour is bold and earthy with slight smokiness, while the dried red form carries a rich sweetness that enhances both colour and taste. With high ASTA colour values, they are ideal for applications where visual impact matters as much as heat. </p>


            <p className="text-secondary dark:text-white">
             At Globistix, we supply premium dry whole chillies, finely milled chilli powder, and uniform chilli flakes, all processed under strict quality controls to meet international standards.

            Beyond products, Globistix offers end-to-end export solutions — sourcing, quality assurance, packaging, logistics, and customised trade support. Whether you are a niche retailer or a large distributor, we ensure reliable supply, on-time delivery, and transparent partnerships.

            Every shipment we move carries more than goods — it carries the reputation of Indian excellence, delivered globally with precision and trust.
